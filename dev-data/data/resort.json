    "description": "As the newest summer destination, anybody can enjoy the thrill and excitement it can offer, which includes a 3,500 sq meter wave-pool that produces the biggest wave (Tsunami wave). Amana Waterpark considered having the biggest wave pool in the Philippines. It offers 13 different magnificent gigantic kinds of wave. We have over 100 different life-size characters scattered all over the resort that children will immensely enjoy, for more exciting and breathtaking adventure, swim higher with our 300 meter  Zipline and extreme 4D Maxrider. In addition, the resort also offers  picnic grove, souvenir shop and breezy inspired cottages made of local materials.\nThe concept for AMANA was first envisioned when the sister-resort, Tampisaw Beach Resort in Iba, Zambales was opened on March 28, 2008. A much bigger resort with a more wide-ranging clientele was conceived which will cater to the customer's total enjoyment! Best amenities, world-class services with distinctly Filipino warmth of hospitality, comfort and convenience for a reasonable cost giving value for one's hard-earned money are just one of the many driving force that molded AMANA Water Park to what is today.\nImmediately after the acquisition of 8.4 hectares rice field property on June 23, 2008- development was then undertaken for what would be AMANA Water Park. To get the best ideas for the theme of the upcoming water park, Mr. Roque went to about 50 different resorts in Luzon to do ocular and get the best ideas that he could incorporate for his project. On August of the same year groundbreaking commenced and nine (9) months after, the vision was realized in the opening of the AMANA Water Park on March 28, 2009. To date, AMANA has property area of 14 hectares and been able to cater to its maximum capacity of customer at an unbelievable 13,000 visitors in a given time- proving that in such short a time the Water Park had reached its maximum potential. For this reason we are raising the bar to the higher level of excellence and envision of making AMANA Water Park to become the best resort in Luzon be it even nationally and internationally.",

The concept of a leisure park that would be very affordable to all people of different walks of life which its facilities would be at par with the international standards of providing recreation to the family.\nIndeed from the very beginning, the management has been very optimistic on providing every guest an 'experience' - such experience to be noted as 'unique' in the sense that he/she would feel not only satisfied but as well as delighted everytime he or she leaves the place.\nWith this in mind, the theme under the sea (water world) finally became the final concept to which gave the park its present image. The biggest attraction, the waves at the 2,788.52 sq. m. pool has become the centerpiece of the project. From the Noah’s Arc at the kiddie pool, to the Neptune’s Diner, every guest is promised an unforgettable experience.\nFrom the imaginative minds of eight (8) managers / co-owners of the Corporation - The young, talented, dynamic descendants of the owners, and from the regular tedious meetings of board members for almost a year and a half has finally materialized, 8 Waves Waterpark was conceived in July, 2000 in the province of Bulacan, in the town of San Rafael. Surely, every Bulakeño will be proud of 8 Waves Waterpark - the biggest wave pool attraction in the country today.",
